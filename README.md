# App Select Input

A customizable and reusable select input component for React applications, integrated with `styled-components` for enhanced styling and layout flexibility. `AppSelectInput` allows for easy implementation of a select input field with additional features such as custom styling, error handling, and a predefined set of options.

## Installation

Before you can use `AppSelectInput`, you need to ensure that `react`, `react-select`, and `styled-components` are installed in your project. If not already installed, you can add them by running:

```bash
npm install react react-select styled-components
```

After ensuring the peer dependencies are installed, you can install `AppSelectInput` using npm:

```bash
npm install app-select-input
```

## Usage

Here is a simple guide on how to use the `AppSelectInput` component in your React application:

1. **Import the Component**

   First, import `AppSelectInput` into your component file.

   ```javascript
   import AppSelectInput from 'app-select-input';
   ```

2. **Prepare Options**

   Prepare the options for the select input. Each option should be an object with `label` and `value` properties.

   ```javascript
   const options = [
     { value: 'option1', label: 'Option 1' },
     { value: 'option2', label: 'Option 2' },
     // Add more options as needed
   ];
   ```

3. **Implement the Component**

   Implement `AppSelectInput` in your component's render or return method. Pass the `options` and any other props you need, such as `value`, `setValue`, `className`, `width`, `errorMessage`, and `text`.

   ```jsx
   function MyComponent() {
     const [selectedValue, setSelectedValue] = useState('');

     return (
       <div>
         <AppSelectInput
           options={options}
           value={selectedValue}
           setValue={setSelectedValue}
           errorMessage="Please select an option"
           text="Select your option"
         />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

4. **Styling**

   `AppSelectInput` accepts a `className` prop for custom styling. You can also customize the width and provide an error message directly.

## Customization

The component is designed to be flexible. You can customize the look and feel of your select input by passing a `className` for custom CSS or by using the `styles` prop to provide custom styles directly to the `react-select` component.
